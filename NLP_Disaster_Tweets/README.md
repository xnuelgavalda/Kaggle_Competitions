## General Information

The purpose of this Kaggle competition is to predict natural disasters using the tweets written in times of emergency. 
Everyone with a handy can immediately communicate an emergency using Twitter. But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data

Each sample in the train and test set has the following information:
- The text of a tweet.
- A keyword from that tweet.
- The location the tweet was sent from.


Practical purpose: Practice the implementation of different classification Machine Learning algorithms for Natural Language Processing.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.6.9
- scikit-learn 0.24.2


## Project Status
Project is: _complete for now_ 


## Room for Improvement
For sure, there is room of improvement! This is the first attempt to implement NLP.
